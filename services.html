            <h2>What is a car service?</h2> <br><br>
            <p>A car service is when you take your car to a garage for a routine check up. Our mechanic will look <br>at your car’s condition and check parts for wear and tear, like brakes, oil, filters and engine belt. <br><br><br>It’s common for the garage to replace your oil filter as part of the service. We may recommend <br>that you replace other car parts too. That way, getting your car serviced can help you spot any <br>issues and fix them before they cause a breakdown. <br><br><br>Regular servicing also helps to prolong the life of your car. A complete service history can even <br>help with the resale value of your car as it shows that it's been well looked after.</p>

            <h2>How often should you service your car?</h2><br><br>
            <p>Most modern cars will have a service indicator to remind you when your service is due. This is <br>likely to take into account the time and mileage since your last service. <br><br><br>Details of your car’s recommended service schedule will be in the handbook. Many <br>manufacturer’s recommend getting a service every 10,000 - 20,000 miles depending on the type <br>of car you have. <br><br><br>Some garages sell their services based on a recommended period of time or amount of miles, <br>such as:</p>
            <br><li>Interim service - After 6 months or 6,000 miles, whichever comes first.</li>
            <li>Full service - After 12 months or 12,000 miles, whichever comes first.</li>
            <li>Major service - After 24 months or 24,000 miles, whichever comes first.</li>
            <br><br><br>
            <h2>Checks during a car service can include:</h2><br><br>
            <li>Engine oil and oil filter</li>
            <li>Light, tyre, bodywork and exhausts</li>
            <li>Brakes and steering</li>
            <li>Fluid and coolant levels</li>
            <li>Suspension</li>
            <li>Car battery</li> <br><br>
            <p>Your garage will replace certain worn car parts and fluids during your service. But how many <br>replacement parts and changes you get depends on the type of service you book.</p> <br><br><br>
            <h2>How much does a car service cost?</h2><br><br>
            <p>The average cost of a car service varies from garage to garage and depends on what type of <br>service you needed. <br><br><br>Prices at independent garages will vary the most, but our charges will be listed below<br>Here's our standard Prices:</p>
           <br><br> <li>An interim service could cost around ₦15,000 - ₦30,000.</li>
            <li>A full service could cost ₦50,000.</li>
           <br><br> <p>The cost of the service won’t include certain parts if they need replacing.</p><br><br><br>
